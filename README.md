# LEETCODE PROBLEMS REPOSITORY
Problem 1:<br>
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size n, find the maximum difference between nums[i] and nums[j] (i.e., nums[j] - nums[i]), such that 0 <= i < j < n and nums[i] < nums[j].
Return the maximum difference. If no such i and j exists, return -1.

Problem 2:<br>
You are given a 0-indexed integer array arr, and an m x n integer matrix mat. arr and mat both contain all the integers in the range [1, m * n].
Go through each index i in arr starting from index 0 and paint the cell in mat containing the integer arr[i].
Return the smallest index i at which either a row or a column will be completely painted in matrix.

Problem 3:<br>
You are given a map of a server center, represented as a m * n integer matrix grid, where 1 means that on that cell there is a server and 0 means that it is no server. Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.
Return the number of servers that communicate with any other server.

Problem 4:<br>
There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].
A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).
Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

Problem 5:<br>
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course ai first if you want to take course bi.
For example, the pair [0, 1] indicates that you have to take course 0 before you can take course 1.
Return a boolean array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.

Problem 6:<br>
You are given a 0-indexed 2D matrix grid of size m x n, where (r, c) represents:
A land cell if grid[r][c] = 0, or a water cell containing grid[r][c] fish, if grid[r][c] > 0.
A fisher can start at any water cell (r, c) and can do the following operations any number of times:<br>
-Catch all the fish at cell (r, c).<br>
-Move to any adjacent water cell.<br>
Return the maximum number of fish the fisher can catch if he chooses his starting cell optimally, or 0 if no water cell exists.
An adjacent cell of the cell (r, c), is one of the cells (r, c + 1), (r, c - 1), (r + 1, c) or (r - 1, c) if it exists.

Problem 7:<br>
In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.<br>
You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.<br>
Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.
