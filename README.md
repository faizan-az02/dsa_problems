Problem 1:<br>
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size n, find the maximum difference between nums[i] and nums[j] (i.e., nums[j] - nums[i]), such that 0 <= i < j < n and nums[i] < nums[j].
Return the maximum difference. If no such i and j exists, return -1.

Problem 2:<br>
You are given a 0-indexed integer array arr, and an m x n integer matrix mat. arr and mat both contain all the integers in the range [1, m * n].
Go through each index i in arr starting from index 0 and paint the cell in mat containing the integer arr[i].
Return the smallest index i at which either a row or a column will be completely painted in matrix.

Problem 3:<br>
You are given a map of a server center, represented as a m * n integer matrix grid, where 1 means that on that cell there is a server and 0 means that it is no server. Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.
Return the number of servers that communicate with any other server.
